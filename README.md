Stage Pi: Digital Stage Box using Raspberry Pi

Project Description
Stage Pi is an open-source project dedicated to creating a versatile and affordable digital stage box solution using the power of the embedded linux.

This project aims to provide musicians, sound engineers, and live event enthusiasts with a robust, customizable, and portable system for audio routing, processing, and control in live performance environments.

Traditional stage boxes can be bulky and expensive. Stage Pi leverages the compact and cost-effective Raspberry Pi to offer a flexible alternative, enabling users to build their own digital audio network interface tailored to their specific needs.
Features

Customizable Audio Routing: Configure inputs and outputs to suit various stage setups.
Low-Latency Audio: Designed for real-time audio performance.
Network Integration: Connects seamlessly with digital audio consoles and other network-enabled devices (e.g., Dante, or custom protocols).
Compact & Portable: Built around the small form factor of the Raspberry Pi.
Open Source: Fully customizable and extensible by the community.
Web Interface (In Progress): Easy configuration and monitoring via a web browser (future development).

Technologies Used
Hardware:
Raspberry Pi (e.g., Raspberry Pi 4 Model B)
HiFiBerry HAT: A high-quality audio HAT (Hardware Attached on Top) for the Raspberry Pi (e.g., HiFiBerry DAC+ ADC Pro, HiFiBerry Digi+ I/O).

XLR Ports: For professional audio input and output connections.
Ethernet and Wifi connectivity
Custom enclosure (recommended)

Software:
Raspberry Pi OS
ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture)
JACK Audio Connection Kit (or PipeWire for modern systems)
Custom Python applications for control and routing logic.
Network audio protocols (e.g., OSC, custom UDP/TCP for control; Dante )

Getting Started
Prerequisites
A Raspberry Pi (Raspberry Pi 4 recommended)
A suitable power supply for the Raspberry Pi
An SD card (16GB or larger recommended)
A compatible HiFiBerry HAT
Ethernet cable
Installation

Flash Raspberry Pi OS:
TBD

(Detailed instructions on how to configure audio routing, connect to a mixer, and control the stage box will be added here as the project develops.)
